  firstTimeDialogue:
  - 'Oh hi, tall pointy-eared one! Don''t worry, I''m not a bad slime-wait you don''t
    even seem scared of me... You''re not from around here, are you? '
  - Well that's none of my business to pry into. I'm Dan, a farmer around these parts!
    If you ever want to buy some seeds off of me, I'm your slime!
  - Here, take a few carrot seeds as a greeting gift! You can plant them by selecting
    them and pressing `E` above the soil here.
  regularDialogue:
  - Unfortunately, I've only got carrot seeds in stock right now. Interested in some?
